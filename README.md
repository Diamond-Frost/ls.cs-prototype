# ls.cs prototype
a windows c# ls prototype implementation, configurable

compile with VS .net core 3.1 and the system.io.filesecurity.accesscontrol package

usage:
ouputfilename.exe (henceforth: ls)

```
ls --list 
ls -mAOGdts
ls --outformat "%f [%m] %d %t %Ol : %G
```
etc, you can read the code, might do stuff with this some other time, if you wanna contact or ask, open issue, or dm (does that exist here?), or discord, idk

first time making coding in c#, dont expect much, not a good programmer

if you have some improvement, tell me, or do it yourself, idk if i'll be able to implement, but i'd try
