# ls.cs prototype
a windows c# ls prototype implementation, configurable via console

compile with VS .net core 3.1 C# and the system.io.filesecurity.accesscontrol package or VS .net framework C# (preferably 4.8)

usage:
ouputfilename.exe (henceforth: ls)

```
ls --list 
ls -mAOGdts
ls --outformat "%f [%m] %d %t %Ol : %G"
```
etc, you can read the code, might do stuff with this some other time, if you wanna contact or ask, open issue, idk

first time coding in c#, dont expect much, im not a good programmer

if you have some improvement, tell me, or do it yourself, idk if i'll be able to implement everything, but i'll try
